This GitHub is a showcase of my favorite projects. You can find the following files:

## :space_invader: 5D Fundamentals
This folder contains the index file to the work done in my 5D Fundamentals class. This class focused on the basics of HTML and CSS and how to apply it. Along with regular assignments we had two main projects. 
* **Midterm Project:** We were tasked to create a mobile app all in HTML code. 
* **Final Project:** We had to create a responsive haiku poem. To advance through the poem click the coloured text.

The link to the original repository can be found [HERE](https://amaans1.github.io/5D-Fundies/).
