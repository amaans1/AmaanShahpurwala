In this final project, we created a Spending Log. This is a website where you can enter things you've spent money on, and it calculates your total expenditure based on category and date. In our code package, you can find the following files:

index.html - This is the bare structure of our page. Each section of our page has been separated into its own div element. This is where you can find the input fields for new items and the structure for the spending list and buttons for the page. 

style.css - This is the CSS styling for our project. Here you can find all the text and colour properties of the page, along with the formatting for the graphs.

script.js - This file contains the JavaScript code that makes the project run. We organized our project to use an array of data, with each element being a new listing on our log. From there, a variety of functions both organize the array data into the spending log, and graph the information onto the website. This file also includes functionalities for adding new list items and attaching certain events to different buttons.
